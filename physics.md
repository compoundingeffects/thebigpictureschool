# **Physics**

## Building Blocks
- **Matter**: Stuff with mass that takes up space
- **Energy**: Ability to do work or cause change
- **Tiny particles**: Things like quarks and electrons that make up matter

## Main Forces
1. **Gravity**: Pulls things with mass together
2. **Electromagnetic**: Acts between charged particles
3. **Strong Nuclear**: Holds atom centers together
4. **Weak Nuclear**: Causes some atoms to break down

## Key Ideas
- Things stay the same unless changed (conservation laws)
- Physics works the same everywhere (symmetry)

## Important Equations
- **Newton's Laws**: Describe how things move
- **Maxwell's Equations**: Explain electricity and magnetism
- **Schr√∂dinger Equation**: Describes tiny particle behavior
- **Einstein's Equations**: Show how matter affects space and time

## Quantum Weirdness
- Particles can act like waves
- Can't know everything about a particle at once
- Some particles are connected, no matter how far apart

## Building Up
Using these basics, we can understand more complex ideas like:
- How heat works (thermodynamics)
- How particles behave in groups (statistical mechanics)
- How light behaves (electromagnetism and optics)
- How tiny particles interact (quantum field theory)

By starting with these simple ideas, we can explain lots of things in the physical world.
