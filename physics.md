# **Physics**

## 1. Basic Building Blocks

- **Matter and Energy:** Everything is either things (matter) or the ability to change things (energy).
- **Elementary Particles:** Matter is made up of tiny pieces of things (elementary particles), such as quarks and electrons.

## 2. Main Forces

Four main forces control how pieces of things (particles) interact with each other:

1. **Gravity:** Pulls things together.
2. **Electromagnetism:** Pushes or pulls electric pieces of things.
3. **Strong Nuclear Force:** Holds the tiniest pieces of things together.
4. **Weak Nuclear Force:** Changes some tiny pieces of things into other tiny pieces of things.

## 3. Key Principles

- **Things stay the same in a sealed system (conservation laws):**
  - **Conservation of Mass-Energy**: Total mass-energy doesn't change (E = mc²).
  - **Conservation of Momentum**: Total momentum stays constant.
  - **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: Total spin (angular momentum) doesn't change.
  - **Conservation of Charge**: Total electric charge remains the same.

- **Symmetry matters:** Physics laws work the same everywhere and in every direction.

## 4. Core Equations

- **Newton's Laws of Motion:**
  1. **First Law (Inertia)**: Things keep moving unless something stops them.
  2. **Second Law (F=ma)**: Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma).
  3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: Every push has an equal push back.

- **Maxwell's Equations:** Describe how electricity and magnetism work.
- **Schrödinger's Equation:** Explains how very small things behave over time.
- **Einstein's Field Equations:** Shows how matter and energy bend space and time.

## 5. Quantum Mechanics Basics

- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Tiny things act like both waves and particles.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Can't know exactly where something is and how fast it's moving.
- **Quantum Entanglement:** Some particles affect each other instantly, no matter how far apart.

## 6. Building Up from Basics

From these basics, we can understand more complex things like:

- **Thermodynamics**: How heat and energy flow.
- **Statistical Mechanics**: How lots of particles behave together.
- **Electromagnetism and Optics**: How light works.
- **Quantum Field Theory**: How the smallest bits of the universe interact.

By starting with these simple ideas, we can explain most of what happens in the physical world.
