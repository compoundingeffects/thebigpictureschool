# **Biology**

## 1. Matter and Energy

**Fundamental Principle:**
All living things are composed of matter and require energy to maintain life.

- **Atoms and Molecules:** At the most basic level, all organisms are made of atoms, which combine to form molecules. The key molecules in biology include water, proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids.

## 2. Cellular Basis of Life

**Fundamental Principle:**
The cell is the basic unit of life.

- **Cell Theory:** All living organisms are made up of cells. Cells arise from pre-existing cells.
- **Cell Structure:** Cells are composed of a cell membrane, cytoplasm, and genetic material (DNA). Eukaryotic cells also have a nucleus and organelles.
  
## 3. Genetic Information

**Fundamental Principle:**
Genetic information is stored in DNA and dictates the structure and function of organisms.

- **DNA and Genes:** DNA is a molecule that carries the genetic instructions used in the growth, development, functioning, and reproduction of all living organisms. Genes are segments of DNA that encode specific proteins.
- **Protein Synthesis:** The process by which cells build proteins based on the instructions in DNA involves transcription (copying DNA to mRNA) and translation (mRNA to protein).

## 4. Biochemical Reactions

**Fundamental Principle:**
Biochemical reactions underpin all biological processes.

- **Metabolism:** The set of life-sustaining chemical reactions within the cells of living organisms. Metabolism includes catabolism (breaking down molecules to produce energy) and anabolism (synthesizing complex molecules from simpler ones).
- **Enzymes:** Proteins that act as catalysts to speed up biochemical reactions, making them efficient and controlled.

## 5. Homeostasis

**Fundamental Principle:**
Living organisms maintain a stable internal environment.

- **Regulation and Feedback:** Homeostasis involves regulating internal conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, glucose levels) through feedback mechanisms. For example, the human body maintains a constant internal temperature through sweating and shivering.

## 6. Evolution

**Fundamental Principle:**
Life evolves over time through processes such as natural selection.

- **Natural Selection:** The process where organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. This is a key mechanism of evolution.
- **Adaptation:** Traits that increase an organismâ€™s chance of survival and reproduction become more common in a population over generations.

## 7. Ecology

**Fundamental Principle:**
Organisms interact with each other and their environment.

- **Ecosystems:** Biological communities of interacting organisms and their physical environment. 
- **Energy Flow and Nutrient Cycles:** Energy flows through ecosystems in food chains and webs, while nutrients cycle through biogeochemical cycles (e.g., carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle).

By breaking down biology into these first principles, we can understand the complex interactions and processes that define life. Each principle builds upon the previous one, creating a coherent picture of how biological systems operate from the atomic level to the complexity of ecosystems.
