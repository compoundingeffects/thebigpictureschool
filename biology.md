## Biology

1. **Matter and Energy**: Everything alive is made of stuff and needs fuel to keep going. Just like a car needs gas, living things need energy. The basic building blocks are atoms, which join together to make molecules. In living things, the most important molecules are water, proteins, fats, sugars, and DNA.

2. **Cellular Basis of Life**: Cells are like tiny factories that make up all living things. Every living thing, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, is made of cells. New cells only come from existing cells splitting. Each cell has a boundary (like a fence), gooey stuff inside (like jelly), and instructions (DNA). More complex cells also have a control center (nucleus) and special parts that do specific jobs (organelles).

3. **Genetic Information**: DNA is like a cookbook for life. It contains all the recipes (genes) that tell an organism how to grow, work, and make more of itself. When a cell needs to make something, it first copies the recipe from DNA to a messenger (mRNA), then uses that message to build proteins, which do most of the work in cells.

4. **Biochemical Reactions**: Life is powered by tiny chemical changes happening all the time inside cells. This is called metabolism. It's like a never-ending process of breaking down food for energy and using that energy to build things the cell needs. Special proteins called enzymes help speed up these reactions, like adding cooking oil to a squeaky hinge.

5. **Homeostasis**: Living things try to keep everything inside just right, not too hot or cold, not too acidic or basic. It's like how we adjust the thermostat to keep a room comfortable. Our bodies do this automatically, like sweating when we're hot or shivering when we're cold.

6. **Evolution**: Over long periods, living things change to better fit their surroundings. Those that fit in best tend to survive and have more babies, passing on their helpful traits. It's like if only the fastest runners in a group could get food - over time, the whole group would become faster runners.

7. **Ecology**: No living thing exists alone. Everything interacts with other living things and its surroundings. This whole system is called an ecosystem. Energy moves through the system as animals eat plants and other animals. Materials like carbon and nitrogen get recycled, used over and over by different parts of the ecosystem.

By understanding these basic ideas, we can start to see how all the complex parts of biology fit together, from the tiniest parts of cells up to whole ecosystems.
