# Law

### 1. **Human Nature and Social Needs**
At the most fundamental level, laws arise from human nature and the necessity for social order. Humans have a basic need to live in organized communities for safety, cooperation, and mutual benefit.

- **Safety and Security**: Individuals seek protection from harm and assurance that their lives and property will be safe.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Humans need mechanisms to resolve disputes and conflicts in a peaceful manner.
- **Social Cooperation**: To achieve common goals, people need a framework that facilitates cooperation and coordination.

### 2. **Norms and Rules**
To address these basic needs, societies develop norms and rules:

- **Norms**: Informal understandings that govern behavior. They are unwritten but understood by members of the community.
- **Rules**: Formalized norms that are explicitly stated and enforced. These rules define acceptable and unacceptable behavior within a society.

### 3. **Authority and Governance**
For rules to be effective, there must be an authority to create, enforce, and interpret them. This leads to the establishment of governance structures:

- **Legislative Bodies**: Institutions that create laws based on the needs and values of the society.
- **Executive Bodies**: Authorities that enforce laws and ensure compliance.
- **Judicial Bodies**: Systems that interpret laws, resolve disputes, and ensure justice.

### 4. **Rights and Obligations**
Laws create a balance between individual rights and societal obligations:

- **Rights**: Legal entitlements that individuals have, protecting their freedoms and interests.
- **Obligations**: Duties imposed on individuals to ensure that their actions do not harm others and that they contribute to the common good.

### 5. **Justice and Fairness**
A core principle of law is to ensure justice and fairness:

- **Justice**: Ensuring that individuals receive what they are due, whether punishment or reward, based on their actions and the law.
- **Fairness**: The impartial and consistent application of laws, ensuring that similar cases are treated similarly.

### 6. **Adaptation and Evolution**
Laws must be adaptable to changing circumstances and evolving societal values:

- **Flexibility**: Legal systems must be capable of adapting to new situations, technologies, and understandings.
- **Reform**: Continuous evaluation and improvement of laws to address new challenges and injustices.

### 7. **Fundamental Principles**
Underlying all laws are fundamental principles that guide their creation and interpretation:

- **Rule of Law**: The principle that all individuals and institutions are subject to the law, ensuring accountability and equality before the law.
- **Separation of Powers**: Dividing governmental powers among different branches to prevent abuse and ensure checks and balances.
- **Human Dignity**: Respecting and protecting the inherent worth of every individual.

By breaking down the concept of law into these fundamental elements, we can understand its purpose, structure, and function from first principles. This approach reveals that law is a human construct designed to fulfill basic social needs, ensure justice and fairness, and adapt to the evolving conditions of society.

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
