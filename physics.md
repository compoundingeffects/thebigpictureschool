# **Physics**

## 1. Basic Building Blocks

- **Matter and Energy:** Everything is either stuff (matter) or the ability to change stuff (energy).
- **Tiny Particles:** Matter is made of super small bits like quarks and electrons.

## 2. Main Forces

Four main forces control how particles interact:

1. **Gravity:** Pulls masses together.
2. **Electromagnetism:** Acts between charged particles.
3. **Strong Nuclear:** Holds atom cores together.
4. **Weak Nuclear:** Causes some atoms to break down.

## 3. Key Rules

- **Things Stay the Same:** In a closed system:
  - Total mass-energy doesn't change (E = mc²).
  - Total momentum stays constant.
  - Total spin (angular momentum) doesn't change.
  - Total electric charge remains the same.

- **Symmetry Matters:** Physics laws work the same everywhere and in every direction.

## 4. Fundamental Equations

- **Newton's Laws of Motion:**
  1. **First Law (Inertia)**: Things keep moving unless something stops them.
  2. **Second Law (F=ma)**: Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma).
  3. **Third Law (Action-Reaction)**: Every push has an equal push back.

- **Maxwell's Equations:** Describe how electricity and magnetism work.
- **Schrödinger's Equation:** Explains how very small things behave over time.
- **Einstein's Field Equations:** Shows how matter and energy bend space and time.

## 5. Quantum Mechanics

- **Wave-Particle Duality:** Tiny things act like both waves and particles.
- **Uncertainty Principle:** Can't know exactly where something is and how fast it's moving.
- **Quantum Entanglement:** Some particles affect each other instantly, no matter how far apart.

## 6. Building Bigger Ideas

From these basics, we can understand more complex things like:

- How heat and energy flow (Thermodynamics).
- How lots of particles behave together (Statistical Mechanics).
- How light works (Electromagnetism and Optics).
- How the smallest bits of the universe interact (Quantum Field Theory).

By starting with these simple ideas, we can explain most of what happens in the physical world.
