## **Biology**

## **1. Building Blocks of Life**

**Everything is made of tiny parts.**

- **Atoms and Molecules:** Think of atoms as the tiniest LEGO bricks. When they connect, they form molecules, which are like little models. These molecules make up everything, including living things.

## **2. Cells: The Tiny Factories**

**Living things are made of cells.**

- **Cells:** Imagine cells as tiny factories that do all the work needed to keep a living thing alive. Some living things, like bacteria, are made of just one cell. Others, like humans, are made of trillions of cells.

## **3. DNA: The Instruction Book**

**DNA is like a set of instructions for making you.**

- **DNA and Genes:** Inside each cell, there’s a special molecule called DNA. It’s like a book of instructions that tells the cell how to make different parts of your body and keep them working.

## **4. Chemical Reactions: The Work Inside**

**Life is full of chemical reactions.**

- **Metabolism:** Inside cells, chemical reactions are happening all the time. These reactions help break down food to give us energy or build up parts of the cell. Enzymes are special helpers that make these reactions happen faster.

## **5. Homeostasis: Keeping Balance**

**Your body likes to stay balanced.**

- **Staying Stable:** Imagine your body is like a car that always needs to be at the right speed. Homeostasis helps keep things like temperature and water levels just right, so everything runs smoothly.

## **6. Evolution: Changing Over Time**

**Living things change over time.**

- **Evolution and Adaptation:** Over long periods, living things can change to better survive in their environment. This is why we have so many different kinds of plants and animals on Earth today.

## **7. Ecology: Living Together**

**Living things interact with each other and their surroundings.**

- **Ecosystems:** Imagine a forest where plants, animals, water, and air all work together. This is an ecosystem, and everything in it affects everything else. Energy from the sun flows through this system, helping plants grow, which then feeds animals.

In summary, biology is all about understanding how living things are built, how they work, how they change, and how they fit into the world around them. Each part builds on the other, like LEGO bricks, to create the amazing diversity of life we see on Earth.
